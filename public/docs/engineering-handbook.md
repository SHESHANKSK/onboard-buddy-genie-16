# Engineering Handbook

## Welcome to the Engineering Team!

This handbook contains everything you need to know about our engineering practices, tools, and culture.

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Open pull requests for all changes
- Require 2+ approvals before merging
- Squash and merge to keep history clean
